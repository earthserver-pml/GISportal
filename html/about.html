         <h2>How to use the OPEC Portal</h2>
         <h4>The right browser</h4>
         <p>The OPEC portal has been built to take advantage of the capabilities of modern browsers so you will need the latest version of Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer. You will also need to have <b>Javascript enabled</b></p>
         
         <h4>Creating a map</h4>
         <p><b>Select some indicators</b> - when the portal first loads you will see the base map only. The panel on the left of the screen enables you to select indicators that are of interest by clicking the select box to the right of the indicator name. A list of popular indicators is displayed first, however, you can select from drop down lists of indicators grouped by Ecosystem indicators or EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) descriptors. Click on the 'Search' tab to find an indicator using the name or part of the name.</p>
         <p><b>Build a map</b> - once you have selected the required indicators, click the 'Next' button to view the map. If the indicator is available for multiple regions or for different intervals you will be asked to refine your selection down to a single layer.</p>
         <p><b>Navigate</b> - click and hold the left mouse button to drag the map around and use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out. You can also zoom the map using the "+" and "-" buttons on the top right of the map.</p>
         <p><b>Analyse</b> - select a bounding box for an area of interest and create a timeseries plot for the indicator, or export these data for external processing.</p>

         <h2>About the Portal</h2>
         <p>The OPEC data portal is an open source project built by Plymouth Marine Laboratory's Remote Sensing Group. The portal builds on the development of several other EU funded projects, past and present, that PML have involvement in. You can find the code on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/pmlrsg/GISportal.git">https://github.com/pmlrsg/GISportal.git
         </a></p>
         <p>The frontend is implemented in HTML and Javascript and uses OpenLayers to display map layers produced by THREDDS, an OGC standards Web Map Service. Additional processing is carried out by a middleware service written in Python that accepts AJAX requests initiated by the browser and transforms these requests into WMS and WCS requests.</p>
